## Abstract / Summary (English)

Weakly-Supervised Dense Video Captioning aims to localize and describe multiple events in untrimmed videos given only an ordered set of event-level captions per video. Recent work synthesizes auxiliary transition captions via LLM to provide additional vision-language alignment, but these captions lack visual grounding and are rigidly assigned to every inter-event gap at a fixed location and duration. To address these, we propose Seeing Before Synthesizing (SBS), a framework that adaptively provides visually grounded linguistic guidance only where warranted. Leveraging a VLM, we generate frame-level narratives for the inter-event gaps and detect transitions from the semantic variation across them. For identified transitions, we then refine inter-event temporal masks by blending the temporal midpoint with the semantic change point and selecting the width that maximizes vision-language alignment. Experiments on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both captioning and localization.
